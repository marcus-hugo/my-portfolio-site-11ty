<h1 class="site__title">About Me</h1>

<p>My first introduction to Programming was in highschool. 
    I wanted to try something different other
    than art. I Didn't quite get the hang of it.  Though, later in my College years, I remember 
    discovering the browser inspector tool and wondered what all that code was!  I was
    still curious about learning to code.
</p>

<p>Fast foward many years, I built my own PC, later studied for the A+ exam, 
    then learned to use the command
    line, which led me back to web development. 
    It was the connection of writing HTML and CSS, then
    seeing <em>visually </em> the output that had me hooked!
</p>

<p>After learning the basics, many sources say to start building projects. 
    And it's true! I've been
    building projects from Frontend Mentor,
    Scrimba, and Udemy.
</p>

<p>I'm currently learning how powerful templating languages 
    are with static site generators, 
    specifically 11ty with Netlify and Netlify CMS. On the server side 
    I'm also learning Wordpress development with PHP.
