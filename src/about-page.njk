    My first introduction to programming was in highschool. I wanted to try something different other than art. I Didn't quite get the hang of it then. Though, later in my college years, I remember discovering the browser inspector tool and wondered what all that code was! I spent some time learning a little bit of HTML then.</p>

<p>Many years later, I built my own PC, later studied for the CompTIA A+ exam, then learned to use the command line, which led me back to web development, which reminded me of typing out html tags. Once I discovered CSS, it clicked for me! It was the connection of writing HTML <em>and CSS</em>, then seeing <em>visually </em> the output that had me hooked!</p>

<p>After learning the basics, many sources say to start building projects. And it's true! I've been building projects from Frontend Mentor, Scrimba, and Udemy to name a few.</p>

<p>I'm currently learning how powerful templating languages are with static site generators, specifically 11ty with Netlify and Netlify CMS. On the server side I'm also learning Wordpress development with PHP.</p>
